# Record Organization

#### There are two types of records:

The "HEADER" record for the characteristics of the series (planet, variable, time power).

The "TERMS" records for the quantities a, S and C in each term of the series

In a VSOP2013 file, series are put in order of the variables \<a,**λ**,k,h,q,p> and, for each variable, in order of the time power (**α**).
